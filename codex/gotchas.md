# Gotchas — Marble Muse

## Spark

1. **Coordinate system fix required.** Marble .spz exports use OpenCV conventions. Set `splatMesh.quaternion.set(1, 0, 0, 0)` after loading to convert to OpenGL/Three.js convention.

2. **Raycasting is expensive on large splat counts.** `splatMesh.raycast()` uses WASM and iterates all points synchronously. On 2M splats, noticeable delay. Use 500k splat exports for web performance. Only raycast on click events, NEVER per-frame.

3. **forEachSplat reuses callback objects.** The `center`, `scales`, `quaternion`, `opacity`, `color` passed to the callback are the SAME objects every iteration. If you need to store values, you MUST copy: `new THREE.Vector3().copy(center)`.

4. **PackedSplats needsUpdate.** After calling `setSplat()` or `pushSplat()`, you must set `packedSplats.needsUpdate = true` to trigger GPU upload. Without this, visual changes won't appear.

5. **SplatEdit position is world-space.** The SDF shapes in a SplatEdit operate in world coordinates. Make sure positions match the actual world-space location of splats in the scene.

6. **SplatMesh scale is uniform only.** `scale.set(x, y, z)` will average the three values. Use `scale.setScalar(x)` for consistent behavior.

7. **SplatEdit disposal.** To undo an edit, remove the SplatEdit from its parent (`parent.remove(edit)`) and call `edit.dispose()` if available. The splats should revert to their original appearance since SplatEdits are non-destructive GPU-side modifications.

8. **PackedSplats is 16 bytes/splat.** Positions are float16 (limited precision), colors uint8 sRGB, scales log-encoded uint8. When extracting and re-inserting splats, some precision loss is expected. This is generally not visually noticeable.

## Marble Export

9. **Use 500k splat exports for web.** The 2M splat version is ~180MB .ply / ~25MB .spz. The 500k version is much more manageable (~45MB .ply, much smaller .spz). For web demos, 500k is the right choice.

10. **Marble exports are static.** No animations transfer. All geometry is frozen at export time.

11. **SPZ vs PLY.** SPZ is ~10x smaller with minimal visual difference. Always prefer .spz for web delivery. Spark supports both natively.

## Claude API

12. **Browser CORS.** For direct browser calls to Claude API, you need the `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access` header. This is fine for hackathon demos but not production.

13. **Response parsing.** Claude sometimes wraps JSON in markdown code blocks (```json ... ```). Always strip these before parsing. Regex: `/```json?\s*([\s\S]*?)```/`

14. **Vision input size.** Base64 screenshots can be large. Resize to ~512x512 before encoding to keep prompt size manageable and response times fast.

## Viewer / Spike Implementation

15. **`raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children, true)` can hit non-splat objects.** Once you add helpers (wireframe click indicator) or `SparkRenderer` to the scene, the first hit may not be the `SplatMesh`. Filter intersections by walking parents and keeping only hits inside the active `SplatMesh`.

16. **Unknown Marble export scale/position makes hardcoded edit coordinates unreliable.** Fit the camera from `splatMesh.getBoundingBox()` and place SplatEdit spike anchors relative to bounds center/size instead of assuming origin-centered content.

17. **Spatial-index Y-crop can collapse on tiny/flat scenes.** Cropping 10% off top and bottom of the Y range may produce an invalid box when the source height is near zero. Detect this and fall back to uncropped bounds instead of building an empty/broken grid.

18. **Keep density comparable across cells.** If density is computed from occupied extents (`worldBounds`) instead of nominal voxel volume, sparse cells with tight point clusters look artificially dense. Use nominal grid-cell volume for stable cross-cell comparisons.

19. **THREE.Color.getHSL() returns hue 0-1, not 0-360.** When using hue for classification heuristics, multiply by 360 to get degrees. The `scene-manifest.ts` color classifier works in degree-space (0-360) after conversion.

20. **Scene-manifest heuristic labels are hints, not ground truth.** The color/height classification in `scene-manifest.ts` (T10 MVP) uses simple rules (green=vegetation, grey+low=ground, etc.). Indoor scenes like libraries will mostly get "structure" and "warm_surface" labels. The labels are context for the LLM agent, not reliable identifiers. Full Claude Vision analysis (T15) is needed for accurate labeling.

21. **Gemini SDK increases client bundle size.** Adding `@google/genai` in browser builds increased the main bundle size warning threshold in Vite. For demo stability this is acceptable, but production should consider code-splitting the agent path or moving LLM calls behind a backend proxy.

22. **Placed extracted assets also need the Spark orientation quaternion.** When re-inserting an extracted `PackedSplats` asset via `new SplatMesh({ packedSplats })`, set `mesh.quaternion.set(1, 0, 0, 0)` before placement. Using identity quaternion can produce incorrect orientation relative to the loaded scene.

23. **Asset extraction can silently return empty if selection is too small or shape type is unsupported.** If a delete op produces no library item, check extraction logs (`[asset-library]`) for: unsupported shape types, low kept splat count, or aggressive thresholds. Current implementation supports `SPHERE`, `ELLIPSOID`, `BOX`, `CYLINDER`, and `CAPSULE`, with `MIN_ASSET_SPLATS=8`.

24. **softEdge on delete operations creates blurry semi-transparent residue.** When SplatEdit uses `MULTIPLY` with `opacity=0` and `softEdge > 0`, splats at the boundary transition gradually from visible to invisible. This produces a ghostly/blurry halo around the deletion. For clean deletions, force `softEdge=0` (hard cutoff). Executor now does this automatically for `action === "delete"`.

25. **Boundary splats near a deleted object are contaminated by the object's color.** When identifying "background" splats around a deletion SDF, splats just outside the surface (small SDF distance) are often still part of the deleted object (the SDF doesn't perfectly match the object boundary). Splats further from the surface are more likely actual background. Weight by SDF distance when sampling color for infill.

26. **Cached splat positions are already world-space — don't apply OpenCV quaternion fix to meshes built from them.** `buildSpatialGrid` transforms positions via `matrixWorld` into world space. If you create a new `SplatMesh` from `PackedSplats` using those positions, do NOT set `mesh.quaternion.set(1,0,0,0)` — that would double-transform them. Only the original scene `.spz` mesh needs the OpenCV fix.

27. **Splats captured at grazing angles around occluded objects look blurry when exposed.** When an object is deleted, surrounding splats that were captured at oblique angles (partially occluded by the deleted object during scanning) become visible and look smudged/distorted. Mitigate by oversizing the deletion SDF by ~12% to eat these degraded boundary splats, then let infill cover the larger hole.

28. **K-means normal clustering can produce spurious tilted surfaces from mixed normals.** When boundary splats include normals from both the floor and the sides of a deleted object, averaging produces a ~45-degree normal that generates a tilted fill disk. Filter by: (a) skip clusters with <15% of the largest cluster's splat count, (b) skip planes with inlier ratio <0.5.

29. **Regular grid sampling for fill splats produces visible dot patterns.** Even with jitter, a structured grid is perceptible. Use ≥60% jitter (relative to spacing) plus slight off-plane displacement (15% of spacing) to break the pattern.

30. **Spatial grid and click points must be in the same frame.** `forEachSplat()` and `getBoundingBox()` are in `SplatMesh` local space, while raycast `hit.point` is world space. If the mesh has a non-identity transform (for example `quaternion.set(1,0,0,0)`), local-grid lookup with world click points will target mirrored/wrong cells. Build the grid in world space (transform bounds + centers with `matrixWorld`) or explicitly convert clicks to local before lookup.
